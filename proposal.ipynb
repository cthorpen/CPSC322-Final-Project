    "1. Source\n",
    "    - Title: _UCI ML Drug Review dataset_\n",
    "    - The dataset was found on Kaggle, from user Jessica Li and one other contributor.  \n",
    "        It can be found in `input_data/drugsCom_clean.csv`\n",

    "1. Format:\n",
    "    - The dataset is in a CSV file format, which makes it easy to convert to a `MyPyTable` instance.  \n",
    "1. Contents:\n",
    "    - _drugName_: Name of drug\n",
    "    - _condition_: Name of condition the drug intends to treat\n",
    "    - _date_: date of review and rating entry\n",
    "    - _usefulCount_: Number of users who found the review and rating useful\n",
    "    - _rating_: 10 star patient review \n",
    "1. brief description of the attributes and what you will use as class information (what you will try to predict).\n",
    "    - The attributes included in the dataset are listed and described above. Another attribute, _review_, was omitted  \n",
    "        from the dataset, as it included lenghty reviews of each drug and holds no usefulness in our interpretation of the data.  \n",
    "    - Class information: the _rating_ attribute will be converted to our class label, and we will predict the 0-10 value  \n",
    "        for each unseen instance.   \n"

    "## 2. Implementation/Technical Merit\n",
    "1. Anticipated challenges in pre-processing and/or classification\n",
    "    - We anticipated the _review_ attribute to disrupt our classification, so we removed it to provide more  \n",
    "        straightforward predictions and learning of the data. \n",
    "    - The number of instances may be too large (over 200,000) and too computationally expensive for us, so  \n",
    "        we may need to remove some instances from the dataset.\n",
    "1. If the number of attributes is large, how will you explore feature selection techniques to pare down the attributes?\n",
